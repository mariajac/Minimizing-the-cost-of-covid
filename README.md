Code used in master thesis chapter on optimizing

For my master thesis I, among other things, did a chapter on optimization and minimizing. 
Initially I tried to use Pythons built in commands on both linear programming and nonlinear programming,
but I eventually settled on doing things my own way.

SEIR-model and SEIRD-model used in the code were developed at an earlier stage in the thesis, see:
